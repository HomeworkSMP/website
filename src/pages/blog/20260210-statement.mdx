# HomeworkSMP Server Host Official Statement
British Columbia, February 10, 2026 — Discord’s announcement on February 9, 2026, regarding mandatory age verification and ID collection is a direct overreach into user privacy. The decision to gather and store personal identification data sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the trust users place in digital platforms.
HomeworkSMP opposes these measures. If Discord proceeds with implementation, we may have no other options but to withdraw from the platform and transition to an alternative that respects user anonymity and data security.

On December 28th, 2025, HomeworkSMP experienced its longest outage since the start of HomeworkSMP, and one of the longest outages since the start of this world.

The outage was announced at 2025/12/28 16:21 (all times in this post are in PST/UTC-08:00, unless specified otherwise), marking the start of the 7-hour complete outage on December 28th, and the 8-hour complete outage on December 30th. The actual outage time reached 19 hours and 40 minutes across both days, however, some were caused by intermittent outages before and after each outage.

The server was operational at 01:02 (12/29) and 23:12 respectively for the outage on the 28th and the outage on the 30th. The server was fully recovered and operational on 2026/1/1 at 16:33.

This outage was caused by pre-existing issues with our infrastructure. However, human error and procrastination also attributed to this prolonged outage.

I would like to apologize for this outage, as this is an issue that could’ve been addressed during a planned maintenance within 4 hours.

## The Beginning

Issues began occurring in the morning hours of December 28th, when players began encountering issues connecting to the server. Some players reported difficulty joining the server, with error messages such as “Network is unreachable”, “Connection timed out: getsockopt”, or “Connection timed out after x ms” displayed to players when attempting to join.

This issue persisted throughout the morning into the afternoon on the 28th, becoming more widespread as the day progressed. At 16:20, it was determined that no player was able to join the server. Due to this widespread issue, an Urgent Server Maintenance was immediately called at 16:21, where the server was brought offline completely to troubleshoot the issue.

## The Outage

Officially, the outage began at 16:21, however, it is estimated that the server was unreachable at least 2 hours or more before the server was officially declared offline. Player GrandmasterMud was seen attempting to join the server at 13:10 but met with error message “Failed to verify username!”, however they were seen playing on the server between 11:37 and 12:00.

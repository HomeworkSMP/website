On December 28th, 2025, HomeworkSMP experienced its longest outage since the start of HomeworkSMP, and one of the longest outages since the start of this world.

The outage was announced at 2025/12/28 16:21 (all times in this post are in PST/UTC-08:00, unless specified otherwise), marking the start of the 7-hour complete outage on December 28th, and the 8-hour complete outage on December 30th. The actual outage time reached 19 hours and 40 minutes across both days, however, some were caused by intermittent outages before and after each outage.

The server was operational at 01:02 (12/29) and 23:12 respectively for the outage on the 28th and the outage on the 30th. The server was fully recovered and operational on 2026/1/1 at 16:33.

This outage was caused by pre-existing issues with our infrastructure. However, human error and procrastination also attributed to this prolonged outage.

I would like to apologize for this outage, as this is an issue that could’ve been addressed during a planned maintenance within 4 hours.

## The Beginning

Issues began occurring in the morning hours of December 28th, when players began encountering issues connecting to the server. Some players reported difficulty joining the server, with error messages such as “Network is unreachable”, “Connection timed out: getsockopt”, or “Connection timed out after x ms” displayed to players when attempting to join.

This issue persisted throughout the morning into the afternoon on the 28th, becoming more widespread as the day progressed. At 16:20, it was determined that no player was able to join the server. Due to this widespread issue, an Urgent Server Maintenance was immediately called at 16:21, where the server was brought offline completely to troubleshoot the issue.

## The Outage on December 28th

Officially, the outage began at 16:21 on December 28th, however, logs show that the server was intermittently unavailable since 11:29. Player GrandmasterMud was seen attempting to join the server at 13:10 but met with error message “Failed to verify username!”, however they were seen playing on the server between 11:37 and 12:00.

The server under intermittent outage for around one hour before going into full outage/maintenance at 15:17. This outage lasted until 00:04, where the server was once again under intermittent outage until 01:02.

The server displayed behaviors of reduced performance after the server was brought back online, where the MSPT of the server was double or more than usual, and TPS dropped below 19.9. We will explain the server behavior as we go, but the server MSPT and TPS did not recover until January 1st, 2026 at 16:33.

## What went wrong and How we approached it (Outage 1)

The pre-existing infrastructure used to host the server actually used Windows as it's operating system. This was not the ideal solution, and for a long time, there were plans to switch the server to Linux. However, numerous issues were met when we tried switching the server to Linux the first time, including the server treating all displays as a secondary display, which prevented us from installing anything properly.

The cause of this outage was mostly due to a random bug/glitch in Windows Firewall, where it filtered and blocked most activities. This was also an issue that we experienced when we were attempting to reach the server as the server was headless and required RDP to conduct most activities. 

Luckily, thanks to pre-existing setup, we were able to use Tailscale to

On December 28th and 30th, 2025, HomeworkSMP experienced two of its longest outages ever, and its longest outage ever since the start of HomeworkSMP. The total downtime across both outages reached 19 hours and 40 minutes, and the server was fully on January 1st, 2026 at 16:33 (all times in this post are in PST/UTC-08:00).
The primary cause of the incident was infrastructure issues, with maintenance debt and human error attributing to prolonging the outage. We would like to sincerely apologize for the significant disruption over these four days. This outage was preventable, and moving forward we will be working towards reducing the downtime of the server and preventing similar incidents.

## Root cause of the Outage

The outage was caused by a combination of infrastructure misconfiguration, operating system limitations, and deferred maintenance, which together resulted in a prolonged and complex recovery.

The server was hosted on Windows, an environment that proved unsuitable for long-term, headless server operation. On December 28, a failure within Windows Firewall began silently dropping inbound and outbound traffic, preventing the server from communicating reliably with external services, including Minecraft authentication servers, and any server joins. This led to connection failures and intermittent outages before the server was taken offline.

The impact of this failure was significantly worsened by overdue maintenance. Plans to migrate the server to Linux had been postponed multiple times, leaving the system in a fragile state. As a result, once the firewall issue occurred, recovery required a full operating system migration rather than a targeted fix.

Recovery was further delayed by procedural and hardware-related issues, including:

- Limited physical access and reliance on RDP for a headless system
- Display and installation issues during OS deployment
- Disk I/O errors during reinstallation attempts
- Hardware failure during recovery operations

In summary, the root cause was an unsuitable operating system and insufficient preventive maintenance, with human and procedural errors contributing to the duration—but not the initiation—of the outage.

## The Outage

### Morning of December 28th

Issues began occurring in the morning hours of December 28th, when players began encountering issues connecting to the server. Some players reported difficulty joining the server, with error messages such as “Network is unreachable”, “Connection timed out: getsockopt”, or “Connection timed out after x ms” displayed to players when attempting to join.

This issue persisted throughout the morning into the afternoon on the 28th, becoming more widespread as the day progressed. At 16:20, it was determined that no player was able to join the server. Due to this widespread issue, an Urgent server Maintenance was immediately called at 16:21, where the server was brought offline completely to troubleshoot the issue.

### Outage of December 28th

The outage was announced at 16:21, with an restoration ETA of 18:00 (at that time). However, the server was offline as early as 15:17, but wasn't officially brought down until 16:23. However, upon investigation, it was discovered the server was experiencing troubles as early as 13:10, when player GrandmasterMud attempted to join the server but was met with the error message "Failed to verify username!", which only happens when the server fails to reach the Minecraft Authentication server. Some logs indicate that the server was intermittently offline starting from 11:30, however we were unable to confirm that beyond a reasonable doubt.

The server was under intermittent outage for around one hour before going into full outage/maintenance at 16:22. This outage lasted until 00:04, where the server was once again under intermittent outage until 01:02.

The server displayed behaviors of reduced performance after the server was brought back online, where the MSPT of the server was double or more than usual, and TPS dropped below 19.9. We will explain the server behavior as we go, but the server MSPT and TPS did not recover until January 1st, 2026 at 16:33.

MSPT (MilliSeconds Per Tick) and TPS (Ticks Per Second) is what we use to measure the performance of a server. Typically, the TPS of a server should sit at 20, while the MSPT should be under 50. Anything under 20 TPS or over 50 MSPT will result in visible lag.

### What went wrong and How we approached it (Outage on December 28th)

The pre-existing infrastructure used to host the server actually used Windows as its operating system. This was not the ideal solution, and for a long time, there were plans to switch the server to Linux. However, numerous issues were met when we tried switching the server to Linux the first time, including the server treating all displays as a secondary display, which prevented us from installing anything properly.

The cause of this outage was mostly due to a random bug/glitch in Windows Firewall, where it filtered and blocked most activities. This was also an issue that we experienced when we were attempting to reach the server as the server was headless and required RDP to conduct most activities.

Luckily, we were able to connect to the server using our pre-existing setup through Tailscale. This allowed us to attempt to troubleshoot the current issue of the Firewall randomly blocking all traffic. However, it was quickly determined that the Firewall would not back down for some reason. After 35 minutes of troubleshooting, the server was brought down at 15:17, which marked the beginning of the complete outage.

During the outage, we decided that best solution would be to pivot to Linux while we have the chance to solve multiple problems at the same time. One of the other problems was that the server would constantly send out alerts regarding missing dependencies. While this on it's own was only a minor issue and has no affect on the gameplay, the performance on Windows is often worse than expected. It is also often more difficult to maintain as there is no dedicated terminal and we often have to rely on RDP, which proved to be a challenge when mobile.

After some consideration, it was decided that the server will switch to Proxmox, a Debian-based Linux OS. Backups for the server immediately began while we prepared for the installation. However, as we've mentioned before, it was quickly determined that it would be very difficult to install a new operating system as the server treated all monitors as secondary displays. This meant that the Operating System would have to be installed on the boot drive on another computer then transferred back to the server. This however, proved to take more time than anticipated.

The alternative solution of install the operating system on another computer was only considered at 17:52. We were already 1h30m deep into this disaster recovery operation with little to no progress. Proxmox was successfully installed at 18:10, but quickly required a reinstall as some properties were not set properly during installation. This issue however, was not detected until 22:05, when we attempted to setup the Minecraft server, but was met with errors instead. The reinstallation began at 22:29, and finished at 22:57.

The rest of the time that the server was offline was spent on moving and configuring the Minecraft server. As noted before, we were able to get the server back online at 00:04 on December 29th. However, it was quickly noted that the server was performing below expectation. Average MSPT reached 44 or higher, with average TPS dropping below 19.9, at 19.6 or lower.

At this point, it has been almost 9 hours of troubleshooting and nearing 1am local. After a few tweaks, we realized that the MSPT isn't budging and decided to return in 2 days to try again. It was decided and announced at 01:53 that there would be another maintenance. Meanwhile, we acknowledged and kept monitoring the TPS and MSPT of the server.

### Between Outages

Between the two outages, we were closely monitoring the TPS and MSPT of the server. The MSPT and TPS of the server reached historic low levels, bottoming at around 9 TPS (1%), with its average being 17 TPS (50%, with players). Sustained MSPT was 50-60ms for the most part, which means gameplay was severely affected by lag.

We would like to note that between 11:00 12/28/2025 and the beginning of the second outage, we were able to verify that no data was lost in the process.

Before we dive into what happened during the 2nd outage, we would like to once again apologize for the prolonged outages that HomeworkSMP experienced within 3 days. While the server maintained an uptime of 99.06% in 2025, we acknowledge that the server was only had an uptime of 78% between 00:00 12/28/2025 and 23:59 12/30/2025. This was unacceptable to both the community and us. Moving forward, we will work on increased maintenance to prevent the same mistakes we have made for the past 2 years.

### How we used the 2nd Outage to fully recover the server (Outage on December 30th)

Due to the degraded performance we were experiencing on Proxmox, we decided to give Ubuntu a shot, as it is something we are quite familiar with, and previously used to host HomeworkSMP (back in 2024). While the outage was scheduled for 12:00, server backups began at 12:38 due to external factors. The backups were complete at 13:20 and the server was taken offline at 13:22. Proper backup steps were taken to ensure no data was lost due to the maintenance, which led to the power off time of the server at 14:59.

Following the power off of the server, we immediately began to attempt the installation of Ubuntu. However, we were met with resistance as the installer refused to launch properly. Reviewing the logs showed disk I/O issues when the installer attempted to install Ubuntu. This required additional time to conduct a full disk clean before we were able to install Ubuntu. The installation was attempted 3 times, between 15:05 and 16:07. The disk was cleaned at 16:17, which led to the attempted installation at 16:28.

At 16:29, the motherboard used to install the operating system on the disk was fried accidentally when I installed a drive with the server still powered. This halted all progress as a functioning motherboard was required to install the OS onto the drive. Luckily, we were able to purchase a new motherboard by 17:19, and be back in operation by 18:47. The 5th Ubuntu installation, which began at 18:55, was successful.

By 19:22, we began configuring the server for the best performance possible. We were able to get the server back online at 21:44, where we had intermittent outages from then until 23:12. This was mostly due to performance tweaks, where we had to apply settings through a full reboot.

All in all, the process of the second outage mostly went smoothly, with the only hiccup being I/O issues and motherboard ordeals. The second outage duration could've been significantly shorter if neither of these happened.

## Degraded Performance after the Outages

As you might've noticed, the last server status on the timeline indicates that the server was still in a degraded state after both outages. The server was able to sustain a higher average TPS and MSPT than the previous one, at 16 TPS (50%). This issue was being closely monitored and investigated, until 2026/1/1 where we discovered that the performance was being throttled due to the battery of the server being removed. The battery was previously removed during the first outage to reduce annoyance, and was not put back in. The server fully recovered at 16:33, when the battery was installed back into the server.
